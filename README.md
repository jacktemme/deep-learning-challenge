# Alphabet Soup Charity Report 

## Overview of the Analysis
This repository employs a neural network model from the Tensor Flow library to help the nonprofit organzation Alphabet Soup determine how likely an applicant that requests funding will be successful in their venture. The model is trained on 80% of the data, and features are based off of a variety of determining factors of the applicant such as, income amount, ask amount, affiliation, etc. The remaining 20% of the data is used to evaluate the model's performance by comparing predicted success outcomes with the actual results. The overall goal of this model is to help this non profit better assess the potential risks of approving funding for an application and therefore allowing the company to make more informed decisions with their money allocation.
